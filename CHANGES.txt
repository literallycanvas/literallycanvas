v0.4.13:
 * Require React 0.14+ (up from 0.13+)
 * SelectShape tool (no GUI for this yet)
 * Use <LC.LiterallyCanvasReactComponent /> as a React component!
 * Rewrote LC.init() (with GUI) to use LiterallyCanvasReactComponent. This
   causes some initialization of the LiterallyCanvas object to be done one
   or more frames after the LC.init() call. Please report any resulting
   bugs on GitHub.
 * CommonJS build that can be install from NPM with "npm install literallycanvas"
 * Improved eyedropper tool
   * Samples background. Should match expected behavior better.
   * Can be used to set fill color as well as stroke color.
 * LC.util.getDefaultImageRect() and LiterallyCanvas.getDefaultImageRect()
   make it easy to figure out the effective bounds of the canvas, whether
   or not it is "infinite." Mostly useful for tool implementations.
 * Fixed CSS Z-ordering bug that caused text being edited to show up on top
   of the color picker

v0.4.12:
 * Identical to 0.4.13 except for a Readme update to make npm happy.

v0.4.11:
 * lc.setWatermarkImage(image)
 * 'scale' parameter for the Image shape
 * Fix text box drag handles (they were invisible)
 * Transparency and saturation sliders in color picker
 * Build a literallycanvas-core library that does not include the tool UI
 * Decouple polygon tool UI from tool; trigger 'lc-polygon*' events
 * Fixed several bugs in SVG rendering
 * Fixed behavior of stroke width picker when switching tools
 * Add ability to programmatically select a shape & move it (no GUI yet)

v0.4.10:
 * Fix the text tool

v0.4.9:
 * The snapshot API is more public. The JSON-suffixed snapshot methods are
   being deprecated in favor of ones that deal with JavaScript objects.
 * New LC.init() options:
   * snapshot: load a snapshot immediately
   * defaultStrokeWidth
   * strokeWidths: defaults to [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30]
   * toolbarPosition can now be 'hidden'
 * Snapshots save and load pan and zoom values, image size, and background
   shapes
 * lc.getImage({margin: {top, right, bottom, left}}) lets you put a margin
   around an image whose bounds are derived from the shapes' bounding rect
 * LC.renderSnapshotToImage()
 * LC.renderSnapshotToSVG()
 * LC.teardown() completely removes Literally Canvas from the web page
 * LC.util.addImageOnload(img, callback) adds a callback to the image's onload
   event without replacing any existing callbacks
 * Polygon tool behavior improvements:
    * On-screen UI to close or cancel, for a better experience on touch devices
    * Cancel current shape if user hits undo, redo, or clear
 * Event handling improvements
 * LC.util.classSet replaces internal usage of React.addons.classSet
 * LC.util.combineCanvases() doesn't draw each canvas twice (probably fixed
   some image rendering bugs)
 * Deprecations (docs provide external replacements):
    * Keyboard navigation (keyboardShortcuts option)
    * lc.getSnapshotJSON()
    * lc.setSnapshotJSON()
    * LC.snapshotJSONToShapes()

v0.4.8:
 * Fix loading an image from JSON.

   lc-pointerdown, lc-pointerdrag, lc-pointermove, and lc-pointerup (#308)

v0.4.6:
 * Fix various awful bugs
 * Move color pickers back to the left, with a slightly better UI than before

v0.4.5:
 * Require React v0.13+ (up from v0.10)
 * UI improvements
 * New option toolbarPosition: 'top'|'bottom'
 * LC.renderShapesToCanvas(shapes, rect, backgroundColor)
 * LC.renderShapesToSVG(shapes, rect, backgroundColor)
 * LC.snapshotToShapes(snapshot) -> shapes
 * LC.snapshotJSONToShapes(snapshotJSON) -> shapes
 * New rendering API
   * LC.defineCanvasRenderer shapeName, (ctx, shape) -> mutate ctx
   * LC.defineSVGRenderer shapeName, (shape) -> string
 * Tools can be implemented with @usesSimpleAPI=false and the new events
     pointerdown, pointermove, pointerdrag, and pointerup
 * Polygon tool
 * Zero-length lines render consistently across browsers (by not rendering)
 * Shape rendering aligned to pixel grid for sharper drawings
 * Zooming works correctly
 * Configurable zoomMin, zoomMax, zoomStep

v0.4.4:
 * Fix idiotic text tool exception

v0.4.3:
 * User-friendly text tool
 * lc.setShapesInProgress(shapes), a better way to draw shapes in progress
 * Tool.willBecomeActive(lc) and Tool.didBecomeActive(lc)
 * Include IE shims for CustomEvent and ctx.setLineDash()
 * Text shapes are now anchored at the top left instead of baseline left.
   Positions are updated automatically.
 * Text bounds are correctly accounted for when exporting to SVG. Text wrapping
   may be incorrect unless you render the text to the canvas first.
 * SVG export produces valid XML with the correct namespace and no newlines
 * Better-ish visual style
 * getImage() content bounds detection includes background shapes
 * Fixed one class of image-not-displaying bugs
 * Line path reuses smoothed points instead of recalculating on load

v0.4.2:
 * lc.getSVGString()
 * LC.setTool() is part of the public API
 * Improved behavior when dragging outside the LC div while drawing
 * backgroundColor initialization option works
 * Allow transparent stroke and fill colors

v0.4.1:
 * Watermark can be included in image output with
   getImage({includeWatermark: true})
 * Line tool allows dashes, arrows
 * LinePathShape can be used without smoothing; set
   {smooth: false}
 * New icons for undo/redo
 * Tooltips everywhere
 * getImage() scales for retina correctly
 * Watermark no longer requires user input to render if image isn't
   loaded at init time
 * Dragging off the canvas while drawing no longer results in a crazy
   line

v0.4:
 * New GUI using React.js
 * Simplified color picker
 * Removed jQuery dependency, though the plugin works if jQuery is present
 * Performance improvements
   * Line path adds points in constant time
   * Line path throttles mouse events
   * requestAnimationFrame is used
 * Retina display rendering is the correct size instead of being scaled up
   half-resolution

   * Redraw layers ('main' or 'background') with repaintLayer(layerName);
     repaint everything with repaintAllLayers(). Removed repaint().
   * getImage() allows rendering drawing at any scale clipped to any rect. Old
     canvasForExport() and canvasWithBackground() are deprecated.
   * setPan() and setZoom() can set position and zoom values directly, in
     addition to the old pan() and zoom() that move them by relative values.
   * getContentBounds() returns the bounding rect of all shapes
 * LC.util functions
   * sizeToContainer() removed in favor of matchElementSize()
   * renderShapes() renders any list of shapes to a canvas, without having to
      instantiate LiterallyCanvas
   * getBoundingRect(listOfRects)
