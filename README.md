Literally Canvas
================

Literally Canvas is an extensible, open source (BSD-licensed), HTML5 drawing
widget that currently supports a minimal set of drawing operations. You can
draw, erase, set the color with the eyedropper, undo, redo, pan, and zoom. It
depends on jQuery and Underscore.js.

Usage
-----

[Full documentation](http://literallycanvas.github.com)

Literally Canvas depends on jQuery (tested on 1.8.2) and underscore.js (tested
on 1.4.2). The "fat" version includes these dependencies. The "thin" version
does not.

Add the files under `lib/css` and `lib/img` to your project, as well as the
appropriate file from `lib/js`. Then do this:

```html
<div class="literally"><canvas></canvas></div>
```

```javascript
$('.literally').literallycanvas();
```

For options and other information, see the [full
documentation](http://literallycanvas.github.com).

The color picker is derived from (but not identical to) [this one by Stefan
Petre](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-colorpicker/). We intend to replace it in
the next version.
